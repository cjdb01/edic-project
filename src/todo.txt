todo
* don't allow input of ascii other than numbers (also no spaces)
* have our own spacing between multiple numbers
* reduce text size each time another number is added
* when a second number is added to the grid, change the sudoku board to NOT_SET
* different colours for non-editable, editable and "notes" (when more than one number is in the box)
* get rid of "0" replace with Sudoku.NOT_SET
* instead of buttons, dropdown menu/toolbar? - like other applications
* then could have options as a dropdown - opening up a new option panel
* implement validate to say something is wrong - can later change this so it's set in the options
* background graphics - main menu graphics - see mac Chess game options/functionality? - photoshop
   * not completely necessary, but still useful - Nat can possibly whip something up
* better solving algorithm
* get better difficulty values
* ask for difficulty when making a new game
* implement save/load in gui
* anything else?
